Installs the required packages (kubeadm and containerd) on all master nodes.

Copies the join command from one of the existing master nodes.

Joins the new master nodes to the cluster using the join command.

Waits for the new master nodes to join the cluster and become ready.

Marks the new master nodes as unschedulable.

Adds the new master nodes to the HAProxy load balancer pool.

Marks the new master nodes as schedulable.

Waits for the nodes to become ready.

an Ansible playbook to add two master nodes to an existing production Kubernetes cluster.

Example:

Let's assume you have a production Kubernetes cluster with three master nodes (node1, node2, and node3) and several worker nodes. You want to add two more master nodes (node4 and node5) to the cluster for increased resiliency and improved performance.

Here are the steps you would need to follow:

Network Configuration: Ensure that node4 and node5 have access to the necessary network resources and are properly configured for communication with the existing nodes. You will also need to update your firewall rules to allow communication between the nodes.

Load Balancer Configuration: Update your load balancer with the IP addresses of node4 and node5 and configure it to balance traffic between all the nodes.

Cluster State: Before adding the new master nodes, make sure the cluster is in a stable state and all nodes are healthy. You can check the health of the cluster using the kubectl command.

High Availability: Configure node4 and node5 for HA and make sure the cluster continues to meet your SLAs after the addition of the new nodes. This may involve updating your HA configuration, such as adding the new nodes to your load balancer pool.

Backup and Restore: Take a backup of your existing cluster before making any changes. This will allow you to restore the cluster to its previous state in case something goes wrong during the process of adding the new nodes.

Security: Ensure that node4 and node5 are properly secured and that they meet your organization's security requirements. This may involve updating firewall rules, configuring SSL certificates, and securing the nodes against attack.

Rollback Plan: Have a rollback plan in place in case the addition of the new nodes fails. This plan should include steps for removing the new nodes and restoring the cluster to its previous state.
