Before adding the new master nodes to your existing production cluster, it's important to ensure that their configuration is consistent with the existing master nodes. Here are some steps you can take to accomplish this:

Clone the existing master node configuration: Before adding the new master nodes, clone the configuration of the existing master nodes. This will help ensure that the new nodes are configured with the same settings, including the same directory structure, disk space, and memory.

Verify the Operating System: Make sure that the new master nodes are running the same operating system as the existing master nodes.

Verify the Version of Kubernetes: Ensure that the new master nodes are running the same version of Kubernetes as the existing nodes.

Verify Network Configuration: Ensure that the network configuration of the new master nodes is consistent with the existing nodes, including IP addresses, subnets, and network security settings.

Verify Storage Configuration: Make sure that the new master nodes are configured with the same storage settings as the existing nodes, including disk space, file systems, and partitioning.

Verify Resource Limits: Ensure that the new master nodes have the same resource limits as the existing nodes, including memory and CPU limits.

Verify Cluster Configuration: Verify that the cluster-level configuration of the new master nodes is consistent with the existing nodes, including authentication, authorization, and network settings.
