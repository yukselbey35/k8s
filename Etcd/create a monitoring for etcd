 set up monitoring for etcd service in your Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you need to follow:

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in your cluster if not already done.
Install an etcd exporter, which will expose etcd metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the etcd exporter.
Create alerts in Prometheus based on etcd metrics to send notifications when the etcd service is down.
Integrate Prometheus alerts with an alert manager to send notifications, such as email alerts, when an alert is triggered.
Visualize the etcd metrics in Grafana by setting up a Prometheus data source and creating Grafana panels to display the metrics.
